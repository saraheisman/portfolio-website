            <h1>Overview</h1>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>This project wsa for my UX design course at Career Foundry.
              The task was to design from scratch a weather forecast app for
              water sports.  Throughout the course I learned about the UX design
              process and best practices, implementing them in my work.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>Being on the water has many challenges, but understanding the
              weather forecast should not be one of them.  This project focused
              on how to enhance people’s experiences when planning their water
              sports activities by giving them a user-friendly and thoughtfully
              designed weather application.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>From cluttered to functional</h3>
              <p>An early priority was to display the weather data in usable and
                convenient ways.  The goal is for the data to be understandable
                for both novice and experienced users.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Amplify the experience</h3>
              <p>Differentiate the app from its competitors by increasing usability.
                Focused on addressing the market’s frustration with existing apps.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>I was responsible for the end-to-end UX and UI design for this
              project.  I conducted various rounds of market and user research
              with water sports enthusiasts and received constructive feedback
              from other UX designers that supported further iterations on the
              prototype.</p>

          <div>
            <h2>Market Research</h2>
              <p>I started this project with research.  This phase was key to learning
                what is currently available to users and in what ways these applications
                could be improved.  I started with a competitor analysis to grasp the
                current market, and discovered what competitors offer and how.  During
                my research I found many applications that offer forecasts that focus
                on water sports.</p>
              <p>For the competitor analysis I focused on the Magic Seaweed and
                Predict Wind apps.  I looked at their overall product and market
                profile.  I then did a SWOT analysis and UX analysis to identify
                the potential areas for improvements.  I gained a solid understanding
                of the strengths of those platforms, as well as the frustrations
                they presented.  This provided a good starting point for brainstorming
                the ways in which the current market offerings could be improved.</p>
              <p>I concluded that the primary areas of improvement to be made are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Clear and understandable navigation is crucial.  It is
                    important that users know where to go for the information they need.</li>
                    <li>Simpler displays of data will ensure that users do not get
                      overwhelmed and discouraged.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Customer interviews provided valuable insight and understanding
                  into how and why they use weather apps as well as what they would
                  need to have a better experience.  I spoke with five people within
                  my personal network who actively participate in water sports at
                  various skill levels.  It was inspiring to hear them speak about
                  their love of water sports and what the current challenges they face.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Goals of User Interviews</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Discover what a person’s motivation is for using a weather
                    forecaster.</li>
                  <li>To understand the pain points of a user’s experience with
                    the current weather forecasters on the market.</li>
                  <li>Discover what information and/or features users value in a
                    weather forecaster.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is very time consuming to look at multiple applications
                    in order to get all the weather reports related to water sports.</li>
                  <li>Screens are often packed with information making the data
                    display hard to understand.</li>
                  <li>Navigation of existing apps is not intuitive which makes it
                    difficult for users to access necessary information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>User interviews confirmed my initial hypotheses from the
                  competitor analysis that clear navigation and simpler displays
                  of data are important to users.  They also brought to light
                  additional areas for improvements that the design of Nalu will
                  have to address.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>Water sports enthusiasts need a way to see weather and water-related
                conditions specific to their sport in a clear and concise manner.
                They do not want to spend time analyzing multiple sites or having
                to decipher information when they are planning a day out or are
                already on the water.</p>
              <p>I synthesized the data collected during these interviews and came
                up with two personas that represent the scope of prospective users.</p>
            </div>

              </div>
              <p>This foundational research informed my design decisions.  I put
                pen to paper in order to further develop a user’s movements as they
                journey through the app.  I created task analysis and user flows
                to provide the initial preparation for designing the framework.</p>
              <p>Next, I used journey maps to envision the end-to-end experience
                of a user progressing through Nalu.  Journey maps are important
                because they focus on both the physical and emotional progression
                of a user while completing a task.</p>
              <p>Based on the data gathered,  I was able to highlight the user’s
                feelings in relation to each task.  This provided insight into
                potential features that could enhance a user’s experience in the app.</p>

            <div>
              <p>These initial steps led to the development of the informational
                architecture of the app, to sketching wireframes, and feature ideation.
                All my preliminary sketches and low-fidelity wireframes were done
                with pen and paper allowing me to rapidly iterate on my designs.
                I found this to be beneficial later on when I began using a design
                tool.  I choose to use Adobe XD as it allows me to design and prototype
                in the same platform.</p>
              <p>I chose to develop and document three features to learn how the
                personas would maneuver through these tasks:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Customizing sport settings.</li>
                <li>Adding a location as a favorite.</li>
                <li>Comparing locations to find the day’s best water conditions.</li>

              <p>After initial iterations, it was time to test my prototype.
                Testing provided an invaluable learning opportunity.  It involved
                six participants ranging in age from 25 to 40 years.  Each tester
                had a varying degree of experience in water sports activities.
                The test took 20 to 30 minutes and involved preliminary questions
                to gain insight into the customer’s goals and frustrations when
                using weather forecast apps.</p>

                <li>Determine if  users can “favorite” a location.</li>
                <li>Discover if users are able to compare multiple locations.</li>
                <li>Determine if the existing navigation encourages users to complete

                <li>Icons are too small making them hard to differentiate between.</li>
                <li>Black text on the compare feature is too small to read clearly.</li>

                  Throughout the iterations the design has become cleaner with
                  more white space being utilized. Overall the funtionality and
                  UI has been improved.  Feedback from user testing guided me to
                  change the sport icons from line icons to solid icons for better
                  visability and differentiation.</p>

                <p>This is the progression of the design for the sport settings
                  screen.  While initially this was designed as a filter for alerts,
                  early on in the iterations it changed to be filters for sport levels.
                  User testing provided insight into which of the weather elements
                  would be necessary here for surfers.  I was also guided by the feedback
                  to change the slider to only adjust one quantity, either minumum
                  or maximum, rather than being able to adjust both (change seen
                  from mid-fidelity to high-fidelity).  As the icons changed from
                  lined icons to solid icons, the selected states changed as well.</p>

                <p>This is the progression of the design for the location cards.
                  These went through many iterations.  Initially I had this as a
                  mini forecast, with just the essential information a user might
                  need to make a decision.  I ended up opting for a cleaner design
                  prompting the users to view a full forecast with all the information.
                  The cleaner design allows the user to not have to enter the full
                  forecast to add a location as a favorite or to go into the compare
                  mode.  User testing confirmed that users wanted to be able to
                  favorite a locaton with out viewing the entire forecast.  The
                  final version has a larger card to ensure that card elements
                  are not too cramped while still being able to highlight the
                  location on the map.</p>

                  While the overall idea of these screens did not change very much,
                  the UI did.  Initially I limited the comparisions to two locations,
                  however this changed after hearing feedback in user testing that
                  they would want to be able to compare more locations.  The weather
                  icons were given a heavier weight for better visability and
                  to provide for better spacing.</p>

              <p>You never know where an idea will sprout from.<br>
              I learned so much throughout this course about the design process.
              Some of my biggest takeaways are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The value of sketching and rapid iterations.  I really loved
                  the process of just sketching and seeing how my ideas developed
                  from one drawing to the next.</li>
                <li>How important it is to use the personas as a reminder of who
                  you are designing for.</li>
                <li>I  need to be more specific when creating my objectives for
                  user testing so that I can draw clear conclusions from the data
                  gathered. </li>
                <li>My prior experience communicating with others and conducting
                  research made the discovery phase of the design process go quite
                  smoothly.  I was able to hone in on the gaps in the market and
                  pain points of the existing applications.</li>
              </ul>
