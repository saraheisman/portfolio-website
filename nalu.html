            <p>
              This project was for my UX design course at Career Foundry. The
              task was to design from scratch a weather forecast app for water
              sports. Throughout the course I learned about the UX design
              process and best practices, implementing them in my work.

            <p>
              Being on the water has many challenges, but understanding the
              weather forecast should not be one of them. This project focused
              on how to enhance people’s experiences when planning their water
              sports activities by giving them a user-friendly and thoughtfully
              designed weather application.

                    and convenient ways. The goal is for the data to be
                    understandable for both novice and experienced users.

            <h2>Market Research</h2>
            <p>
              I started this project with research. This phase was key to
              learning what is currently available to users and in what ways
              these applications could be improved. I started with a competitor
              analysis to grasp the current market, and discovered what
              competitors offer and how. During my research I found many
              applications that offer forecasts that focus on water sports.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the competitor analysis I focused on the Magic Seaweed and
              Predict Wind apps. I looked at their overall product and market
              profile. I then did a SWOT analysis and UX analysis to identify
              the potential areas for improvements. I gained a solid
              understanding of the strengths of those platforms, as well as the
              frustrations they presented. This provided a good starting point
              for brainstorming the ways in which the current market offerings
              could be improved.
            </p>
            <p>
              I concluded that the primary areas of improvement to be made are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clear and understandable navigation is crucial. It is important
                that users know where to go for the information they need.
              </li>
              <li>
                Simpler displays of data will ensure that users do not get
                overwhelmed and discouraged.

                would need to have a better experience. I spoke with five people
                within my personal network who actively participate in water
                sports at various skill levels. It was inspiring to hear them
                speak about their love of water sports and what the current

                  It is very time consuming to look at multiple applications in
                  order to get all the weather reports related to water sports.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Screens are often packed with information making the data
                  display hard to understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Navigation of existing apps is not intuitive which makes it
                  difficult for users to access necessary information.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                User interviews confirmed my initial hypotheses from the
                competitor analysis that clear navigation and simpler displays
                of data are important to users. They also brought to light
                additional areas for improvements that the design of Nalu will
                have to address.

              Water sports enthusiasts need a way to see weather and
              water-related conditions specific to their sport in a clear and
              concise manner. They do not want to spend time analyzing multiple
              sites or having to decipher information when they are planning a
              day out or are already on the water.
            </p>
            <p>
              I synthesized the data collected during these interviews and came
              up with two personas that represent the scope of prospective
              users.

              This foundational research informed my design decisions. I put pen
              to paper in order to further develop a user’s movements as they
              journey through the app. I created task analysis and user flows to
              provide the initial preparation for designing the framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, I used journey maps to envision the end-to-end experience of
              a user progressing through Nalu. Journey maps are important
              because they focus on both the physical and emotional progression
              of a user while completing a task.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on the data gathered, I was able to highlight the user’s
              feelings in relation to each task. This provided insight into
              potential features that could enhance a user’s experience in the
              app.

                These initial steps led to the development of the informational
                architecture of the app, to sketching wireframes, and feature
                ideation. All my preliminary sketches and low-fidelity
                wireframes were done with pen and paper allowing me to rapidly
                iterate on my designs. I found this to be beneficial later on
                when I began using a design tool. I choose to use Adobe XD as it
                allows me to design and prototype in the same platform.

              six participants ranging in age from 25 to 40 years. Each tester
              had a varying degree of experience in water sports activities. The
              test took 20 to 30 minutes and involved preliminary questions to
              gain insight into the customer’s goals and frustrations when using
              weather forecast apps.

                mini forecast, with just the essential information a user might
                need to make a decision. I ended up opting for a cleaner design
                prompting the users to view a full forecast with all the
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                The cleaner design allows the user to not have to enter the full
                forecast to add a location as a favorite or to go into the
                compare mode. User testing confirmed that users wanted to be
                able to favorite a locaton with out viewing the entire forecast.

                The final version has a larger card to ensure that card elements
                are not too cramped while still being able to highlight the
                location on the map.

                This is the progression of the design for the compare screen.
                While the overall idea of these screens did not change very
                much, the UI did.

              <p>
                Initially I limited the comparisions to two locations, however
                this changed after hearing feedback in user testing that they
                would want to be able to compare more locations. The weather
                icons were given a heavier weight for better visability and to
                provide for better spacing.

              Nalu is a weather forecasting application for water sports. It
              allows users to view locations that have water conditions within
              their skill level and to compare locations when they are unsure of

          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>
            You never know where an idea will sprout from.<br />
            I learned so much throughout this course about the design process.
            Some of my biggest takeaways are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The value of sketching and rapid iterations. I really loved the
              process of just sketching and seeing how my ideas developed from
              one drawing to the next.
            </li>
            <li>
              How important it is to use the personas as a reminder of who you
              are designing for.
            </li>
            <li>
              I need to be more specific when creating my objectives for user
              testing so that I can draw clear conclusions from the data
              gathered.
            </li>
            <li>
              My prior experience communicating with others and conducting
              research made the discovery phase of the design process go quite
              smoothly. I was able to hone in on the gaps in the market and pain
              points of the existing applications.
